## About The Project

I came across proxycroak while looking for a service to print proxies for older cards. I enjoyed using it but soon 
discovered that it had been discontinued. Seeing such an excellent service go unmaintained was a shame. I emailed the 
original developer and asked if I could work on the project. They agreed, and since January 2024, I have rewritten, upgraded, 
and maintained proxycroak. I plan to continue to work on this project for the foreseeable future and serve it to the 
community ad-free as my way of giving back to the Pokemon community.

## Built With

- Flask
- Base HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
